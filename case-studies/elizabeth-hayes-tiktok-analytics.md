# TikTok Analytics for Content Creator
**Digital Marketing Analytics | Audience Research | Competitive Benchmarking**

---

## Client Context

**Client:** Elizabeth Hayes, career transition coach  
**Platform:** TikTok (15,000+ followers)  
**Objective:** Data-driven strategy for monetizing audience through TikTok Live event

---

## The Challenge

Elizabeth's content was reaching many viewers, but engagement was declining while followers grew. She needed to understand:

- **Why engagement dropped 12% over 3 months** despite 5% follower growth
- **Which content formats** resonated most with her target market
- **How to convert** passive viewers into paying consultation clients
- **What strategies** successful competitors were using

**Business Impact:** Without addressing the engagement decline, her planned Live event would fail to attract attendees and convert clients, directly impacting revenue.

## My Approach

### 1. Performance Trend Analysis
- Analyzed 3 months of TikTok metrics across 5 traffic sources
- Identified **12% engagement rate decline** (6.7% → 5.9%)
- Discovered **saves dropped 18%** (strongest indicator of purchase intent)
- Found **63% traffic from For You Page** (strong algorithm favorability)

### 2. Content Pattern Analysis
- Evaluated top 5 performing videos (24K-38K views, 7%+ engagement rate)
- Identified winning formula: **problem-solution storytelling**
- Mapped content themes to audience pain points
- Discovered "mistake prevention" content drove highest engagement (38K views)

### 3. Competitive Benchmarking
- Analyzed **6 competitors** (3 Indonesian, 3 international career coaches)
- Documented successful TikTok Live event strategies
- Identified best practices for audience engagement during Live
- Calculated realistic conversion benchmarks (0.2-0.4% for coaching sales)

### 4. Audience Persona Development

Built 2 distinct user personas from behavioral data:

**Persona 1: Corporate Professionals Seeking Career Transition**
- Age: 25-35 years
- Pain points: Stuck in unfulfilling corporate jobs, burnout, fear of instability
- Content preferences: Success stories, step-by-step guides, risk mitigation

**Persona 2: Early-Career Freelancers**
- Age: 22-30 years
- Pain points: Don't know where to start, making costly beginner mistakes
- Content preferences: How-to guides, mistake prevention, practical tools

### 5. Strategic Recommendations

Delivered comprehensive **3-phase strategy**:

- **Pre-Live** (2-3 weeks): Reverse engagement decline, build hype, countdown series
- **During-Live** (60-90 min): Interactive Q&A, problem-solving, soft conversion pitch
- **Post-Live**: Follow-up nurturing, testimonial collection, next event scheduling

**Revenue Projection:** 5-10 consultation bookings from 2,700 core audience (0.2-0.4% conversion rate based on competitor benchmarks)

---

## Tools & Techniques

- **Data Extraction:** TikTok Creator Analytics
- **Analysis:** Excel/Google Sheets (trend analysis, engagement calculations, comparative tables)
- **Statistical Methods:** Engagement rate calculations, trend identification, comparative analysis
- **Reporting:** Executive summary, detailed analysis documents, visual data presentations

## Key Insights

This project demonstrates that **powerful analytics doesn't require massive datasets**. It requires:
- Asking the right business questions
- Finding meaningful patterns in available data
- Connecting insights to specific actions
- Benchmarking against realistic industry standards

**Most Important Finding:** Elizabeth's engagement decline was driven by content drift away from her winning formula. By refocusing on problem-solution storytelling and implementing the pre-Live strategy, she could reverse the trend before the monetization event.

---

## Business Value

For content creators and digital marketers, understanding **why engagement changes** is more valuable than just tracking numbers. This analysis:

- Prevented a failed monetization event (saving time and reputation)
- Provided competitor intelligence for strategic positioning
- Created replicable framework for future content strategy
- Connected content performance directly to business revenue goals
